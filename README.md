# OptiMacMini

This is a guide/log so I know what I have done because after spending 2 days I haven't got any farther. 

I bought a Dell Optiplex 9020 i7 4770 and installed 16 GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. I wanted to find a low profile Radeon card but none were reasonably priced. So I figured I would dive in and do the install in one day. 

I'm using OpenCore 6.0. This EFI is the one I made most recently. I have my own SSDT's made for this machine specifically using the DSDT file that OpenCore spit out. I've also implemented a ton of changes from the guide and various help sources to no avail. 

Basically, I get to [EB|#LOG:EXITBS:START] and then nothing happens.

Every fix for this online has done nothing. 

At this point I am going to try Clover and keep this just in case I can't get that working either.
